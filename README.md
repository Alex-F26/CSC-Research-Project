PROJECT REFLECTION:

Project Name:  

CVE-CWE Mapper 


Description: 

A program that will provide an intuitive and accessible way to visualize a topology containing CVE’s with their respective CWE’s. It will also allow for the creation of new CWE’s.  


Why this project? 

Currently there are thousands of CVE’s that are not linked to CWE’s, which makes it significantly more difficult to analyze said vulnerabilities and find solutions to fix and/or avoid them.  
 

Importance in Cybersecurity: 

A tool like this would help with the automation of CVE mappings, ultimately accelerating the response and recovery times when a cyber attack may occur. 
 

What have others done? 

While there does not seem to be an automated tool for mappings, there are methods to manually link CVE’s to CWE’s, which is currently very time consuming. MITRE has a website that has the current CVE’s, both mapped and unmapped with sections detailing aspects of the vulnerabilities. 


Prior experience: 

Currently I am capable of efficiently traversing virtual spaces, effectively planning for software projects, and developing/testing code following principles of software design. I am familiar with cybersecurity frameworks. 

 
Required experience: 

I will need to learn more about the cyberspace that I will be working in. I’ll need to develop the skills to analyze and categorize CVE’s manually if I plan to find a way to automate the process. 

 
What I hope to learn: 

I hope to learn how to code more efficiently. I hope to learn more about vulnerabilities, weaknesses, how these are used in cyber attacks and how to avoid/fix these exploits 

PROJECT SCOPE:

o Goal:  

-I want to create a program that can facilitate the understanding of CVE’s and their relationship to CWE’s by providing a topology-type of visualization where the end goal is for all CVE’s to be mapped with a respective CWE 
-The program could possibly provide an efficient algorithm to automate the categorization of CVE’s based on certain features or key-words. 
-The program should have the ability to prompt the creation of new CWE’s if the criteria is much too niche 
-This program should facilitate the process of finding the weakness related to vulnerabilities and speed up the recovery process after an attack 

o Scope:  

In-scope: 

-UML diagrams, workflows, introductory/prototype code and website, some resulting CVE to CWE mappings 

Out-of-Scope 

-Fully integrated program that manages to map every existing and future CVE’s to a CWE 

o Deliverables:  

Deliverables include: 

-Diagrams 
-Prototype Code 
-Dataset(Topology) 
-Example visualization(may be within a website) 
-Successful use case scenario 

o Timeline:  

Planning Phase 10/3 - 10/24 
-Conduct more research 
-Expected use cases and results 
-Web conceptualization 
-Collect unmapped CVE’s to test  
-Class diagram 
-Topology visualization 

Coding Phase 10/24 - TBD 
-Simple UI to showcase workflow 
-CVE mapping function 
-Topology Creation 

Test Phase (Synchronized with Coding Phase) 
-Run the code with CVE’s 
-Create a new CWE based on uncategorized CVE’s
